<b>Abstract:</b> In flowchart languages, predicates play an
interesting double role. In the textual representation, they are often
presented as conditions, i.e., expressions which are easily combined
with other conditions (often via Boolean combinators) to form new
conditions, though they only play a supporting role in aiding
branching statements choose a branch to follow. On the other hand, in
the graphical representation they are typically presented as
decisions, intrinsically capable of directing control flow yet mostly
oblivious to Boolean combination.
<br><br>
While categorical treatments of flowchart languages are abundant, none
of them provide a treatment of this dual nature of predicates. In the
present paper, we argue that extensive restriction categories are
precisely categories that capture such a condition/decision duality,
by means of morphisms that coincidentally also named
decisions. Further, we show that having these categorical decisions
amounts to having an internal logic: Analogous to how subobjects of an
object in a topos form a Heyting algebra, we show that decisions on an
object in an extensive restriction category form a De Morgan
quasilattice, the algebraic structure associated with the
(three-valued) weak Kleene logic K_3^w. Full classical propositional
logic can be recovered by restricting to total decisions, yielding
extensive categories in the usual sense, and confirming (from a
different direction) a result from effectus theory that predicates on
objects in extensive categories form Boolean algebras. As an
application, since (categorical) decisions are partial isomorphisms,
this approach provides naturally reversible models of classical
propositional logic and weak Kleene logic.
