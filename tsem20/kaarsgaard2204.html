<b>Abstract:</b> Reversible computation concerns computations that can
be ``undone'' at each step, and has seen applications in diverse areas
such as low-power computing, debugging, and even robotics. Reversible
computation is also foundationally important in both classical and
quantum computing. In this talk, I give a brief overview of the
foundational role of reversibility in classical and quantum
computation, and relate it to recent work showing that categories of
irreversible classical and quantum computations arise as completions
of categories of reversible such. This construction makes clear how,
semantically, irreversible computations arise as equivalence classes
of reversible ones.
