  <b>Abstract:</b>
  I present a generic partition refinement algorithm that quotients
coalgebraic systems by behavioural equivalence, an important task in
system analysis and verification. Coalgebraic generality allows to cover
not only classical relational systems but also, e.g. various forms of
weighted systems and furthermore to flexibly combine existing system
types. Under assumptions on the type functor that allow representing its
coalgebras in terms of nodes and edges, the algorithm runs in time O(m
log n) for input coalgebras with n states and m edges. The generic
complexity result and the possibility of combining system types yields a
toolbox for efficient partition refinement algorithms. Instances of our
generic algorithm match the run-time of the best known algorithms for
unlabelled transition systems, Markov chains, deterministic automata,
Segala systems, and for color refinement. For weighted tree automata,
the instance of the generic algorithm even improves the best run-time
known. The algorithm is implemented in a tool (CoPaR) in full generality
and allows the composition of existing systems types at run-time.
