  <b>Abstract:</b>
Algebras of programs, such as variants of Kleene algebras,
relation algebras or quantales, are useful for program correctness and
verification.  They provide abstractions for various concrete
semantics of programs and computing systems, qualitative or
quantitative. Such semantics typically model program behaviours in
terms of relations or predicate transformers, execution traces or
dependency orders---or they form quantitative extensions of these.
<br><br>
I will argue that many of these algebras and their relationships with
models arise from a uniform construction of convolution algebras from
catoids, which generalise categories to (ternary) relational
structures, and from modal correspondences between catoids and
convolution algebras. The approach combines ideas from representation
theory, group and category algebras, with the duality theory for
ternary relations and boolean algebras with operators. Using catoids
may streamline the development of algebras of programs and their
models.  Only a few simple catoid axioms may need to be checked to
construct a model of a much richer algebraic structure, and lifting
properties from models via catoids to algebras is often
compositional. To construct a Kleene algebra or quantale for a given
application, or a model for a given algebra, it is therefore worth
asking what the underlying catoid might be.
<br><br>
I will explain the approach through two examples: modal Kleene
algebras, which yield algebras of predicate transformers akin to
dynamic logics, and concurrent Kleene algebras, which capture
interleaving and non-interleaving semantics for concurrent systems.
For both cases I will describe the catoids, and often categories, that
formalise the standard semantics.
<br><br>
Combining these two examples, I will aim to explain how the approach
helps justifying the globular n-Kleene algebra axioms, which have
recently been proposed for higher-dimensional rewriting, in terms of
globular n-dioids, and thus (strict) n-categories and n-polygraphs.

Fahrenberg, Ian Hayes, Christian Johansen, Philippe Malbos, Damien
Pous and Krzysztof Ziemia\'nski for their collaboration.
