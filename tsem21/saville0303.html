  <b>Abstract:</b>
  Logical relations are a versatile tool for studying programming languages, with the so-called 'fundamental lemma' characterising the interpretations of terms as exactly those that satisfy every logical relation. In this talk I will explore these ideas in the setting of an effectful programming language Ã  la Moggi's computational lambda calculus.
<br><br>
Starting from a categorical model of an effectful programming language (in the style of Moggi's computational lambda calculus), I will study three inter-related questions, roughly corresponding to the three terms in the title:
<br><br>
1. How can one prove properties of the semantics?<br>
2. How can one refine the model to ensure morphisms only satisfy certain properties?<br>
3. How can one characterise the morphisms that are the interpretation of some term?
<br><br>
    Finally, I will indicate how one can put together these three components to construct a model in which every morphism is definable.
