  <b>Abstract:</b> Programs with a continuous state space or that interact
   with physical processes often require notions of equivalence going
   beyond the standard binary setting in which equivalence either holds
   or does not hold. In this paper we explore the idea of equivalence
   taking values in a quantale V, which covers the cases of
   (in)equations and (ultra)metric equations among others.
<br><br>
   Our main result is the introduction of a V-equational deductive
   system for linear Î»-calculus together with a proof that it is sound
   and complete (in fact, an internal language) for a class of enriched
   autonomous categories. In the case of inequations, we get an internal
   language for autonomous categories enriched over partial orders. In
   the case of (ultra)metric equations, we get an internal language for
   autonomous categories enriched over (ultra)metric spaces.
<br><br>   
   We use our results to obtain examples of inequational and metric
   equational systems for higher-order programs that contain real-time and
   probabilistic behaviour.
