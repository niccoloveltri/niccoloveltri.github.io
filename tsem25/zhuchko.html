  <b>Abstract:</b>
Weak monadic second-order logic (wMSO) is a foundational tool for
specifying regular properties. Traditional decision procedures for
this logic typically translate wMSO formulas into finite
automata. Although the logic is decidable, this approach incurs
non-elementary complexity in the worst-case. Nearly thirty years ago,
the state-of-the-art MONA tool showed that, despite these theoretical
limits, wMSO can be decided efficiently in practice through carefully
optimized automata constructions. We revisit wMSO from an algebraic
perspective by introducing Extended Regular Expressions with
Quantifiers (EREQ). Instead of relying on automata determinization,
EREQ employs symbolic derivatives to perform incremental quantifier
elimination, providing a compositional and symbolic alternative to
classical automata-based approaches. We present a linear-time
translation of wMSO into EREQ and a derivative-based decision
procedure for EREQ.
