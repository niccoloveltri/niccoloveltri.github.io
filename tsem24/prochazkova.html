  <b>Abstract:</b>  
Skew monoidal categories are a generalisation of monoidal categories, where we
omit the requirement for invertibility of constraint morphisms and fix a
certain combination of orientations of those. An early example of this
structure was described by Altenkirch Chapman and Uustalu in 2010 in the paper
Monads Need Not Be Endofunctors. The name skew monoidal category was introduced
in 2012 by Szlachányi, who studied structures induced by bialgebroids.
<br><br>
In my Master’s thesis, I have been studying how monoidal actions of
categories, where we have the existence of a certain adjoint functor, induce a
skew monoidal structure on the actegory (i. e. that acted-upon category). A
large class of examples of skew monoidal categories can be described in this
way, including the example of Altenkirch, Chapman and Uustalu and examples
involving bialgebras, which are special cases of Szalchányi’s motivating
bialgebroid examples.
<br><br>
In this talk, I want to explore some properties of skew monoidal categories
induced by this construction. The adjunction involved in the construction can
be shown to be monoidal with respect to the original tensor of the acting
category and the newly defined skew-tensor on the actegory. This observation is
closely related e. g. to the correspondence between relative monads and certain
ordinary monads described by Altenkirch, Chapman, and Uustalu.
<br><br>
I also plan to discuss how braidings on the acting monoidal category induce
braidings on the induced skew monoidal category. In addition, I will touch on
what are some sufficient conditions for the induced structures to be
closed.</body>
