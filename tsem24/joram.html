  <b>Abstract:</b>
We study two kinds of containers for data types with symmetries
in homotopy type theory, and clarify their relationship by
introducing the intermediate notion of action
containers. Quotient containers are set-valued containers with
groups of permissible permutations of positions, interpreted as
analytic functors on the category of sets. Symmetric containers
encode symmetries in a groupoid of shapes, and are interpreted
accordingly as polynomial functors on the 2-category of
groupoids.
<br><br>
Action containers are endowed with groups that act on their
positions, with morphisms preserving the actions. We show that,
as a category, action containers are equivalent to the free
coproduct completion of a category of group actions. We derive
that they model non-inductive single-variable strictly positive
types in the sense of Abbott et al.: The category of action
containers is closed under arbitrary (co)products and
exponentiation with constants. We equip this category with the
structure of a locally groupoidal 2-category, and prove that this
corresponds to the full 2-subcategory of symmetric containers
whose shapes have pointed connected components. This follows from
the embedding of a 2-category of groups into the 2-category of
groupoids, extending the delooping construction.
