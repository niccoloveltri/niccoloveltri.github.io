  <b>Abstract:</b>
The Rust programming language offers a rich type system,
including sum- and product types. Developer experience is
often similar to that of a high-level functional programming
language. Yet, it lacks a tool for interactively synthesizing
programs based on types; a feature of many functional lan-
guages. <br>
We devise a general term search algorithm, and integrate it
with rust-analyzer, Rustâ€™s official language server, making
it usable from any client supporting standard LSP features. It
suggests expressions for unfinished parts of a Rust program
(as long as their type is known), or offers terms of matching
type while typing via autocompletion. We develop the algo-
rithm in three iterations. The first iteration is a backward
search, inspired by Agsy, a similar tool for Agda proof as-
sistant. The second iteration reverses the search direction,
simplifying the caching of intermediate results. In the final
iteration, we implement a tactic-based bidirectional search.
This algorithm can synthesize terms in many more situations
than the previous iterations, without a significant decrease
in performance. <br>
To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we run it
on 155 popular open-source Rust libraries. We delete parts
of their source code, creating holes, and let the algorithm
re-synthesize the missing code. We measure how many holes
the algorithm can fill and how often it suggests the original
code. <br>
We have upstreamed our code, and term search is available
as part of the official rust-analyzer distribution starting
from v0.3.1850
