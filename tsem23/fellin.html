  <b>Abstract:</b>
  Abstracting Glivenko's theorem from double negation and
provability to a nucleus on an arbitrary set with an inductively
generated single-succedent entailment relation requires that all
generating rules of the latter remain admissible in the Kleisli
extension, i.e. when applying the nucleus to the succedent of
every premiss and the conclusion. This conservation criterion is
automatic for every rule which is right invariant, i.e. all
premisses and the conclusion of which have the very same
succedent. In the single-succedent calculi for minimal
propositional, infinitary and first-order predicate logic, the
only rules which cannot be expressed as right invariant rules are
the right rules for implication, infinite conjunction and the
universal quantifier. The conservation criteria for these
critical rules with respect to any nucleus on formulas are
equivalent to the corresponding counterparts of Kuroda's double
negation shift.
