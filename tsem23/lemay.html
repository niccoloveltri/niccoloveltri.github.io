  <b>Abstract:</b>
Drazin inverses are a special kind of generalized inverse that have
been extensively studied and have many applications in ring theory,
semigroup theory, and matrix theory. Drazin inverses can also be
defined for endomorphisms in any category. In this talk I'll give an
introduction to Drazin inverses from a categorical perspective. Based
on this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18226.pdf which is joint work
with Robin Cockett and Priyaa Varshinee Srinivasan.
