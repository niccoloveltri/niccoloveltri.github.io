  <b>Abstract:</b>
  There are several constructions of models of set theory in type
theory, one of the first ones being Aczel's 1978 [1] model of set
theory in type theory. In this model he uses a certain W-type, a
type of wellfounded trees, as the type of sets, and equality is
interpreted by a binary relation on these trees, which is not
equal to the Martin-Löf identity type.
<br><br>
In this talk I will give an overview of how we can model set
theory in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) using trees, but with
equality interpreted as the identity type. Starting from Aczel's
model we first carve out a subtype of the W-type he used and see
that this gives us such a model. Since the type used for the
model is a type of wellfounded trees, the sets in the model will
be wellfounded, i.e. there is no infinite descending sequence of
sets, x₀ ∋ x₁ ∋ ⋯ ∋ xₙ ∋ xₙ₊₁ ∋ ⋯ So in this model, the axiom of
foundation holds.
<br><br>
One can then ask the question, what happens if we take the
corresponding M-type which is the dual of Aczel's W-type as the
starting point for a model? This is a type of non-wellfounded
trees from which we carve out the corresponding subtype to the
one we used for the wellfounded trees. This gives us a model of
set theory with equality interpreted as the identity
type. However, as this model builds on non-wellfounded trees, it
contains sets which are anti-wellfounded, i.e. they contain an
infinite descending sequence of elements. The simplest example of
such a set is the Quine atom: the set which contains itself.
<br><br>
Since this model contains anti-wellfounded sets, the axiom of
foundation does not hold. The question then arises, is there
another axiom which to replace foundation with, which holds in
the model? In fact, there are several different alternatives for
the axiom of foundation for non-wellfounded sets. The most common
of these is perhaps Aczel's anti-foundation axiom. However, this
axiom turns out not to hold in our model. Instead, another
anti-foundation axiom, proposed by Scott, holds in our model.
<br><br>
During the talk I will give examples of how sets are constructed
in the models and give an outline of why the set theoretic axioms
hold. Moreover, if time allows for it, I will explain how we can
generalize the wellfounded model to higher homotopy levels,
something we can do since we are working in a framework (HoTT)
which contains higher structure.
